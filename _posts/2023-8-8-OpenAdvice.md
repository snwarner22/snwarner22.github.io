#### I chose the chapter Love the Unknown in Open Advice for my reading assignment, during our final week of Catalyst. It drew me in, due to its surprise seeking, ambitious approach towards things. I feel this chapter nudged me to learn more programming languages and explore other technology domains. The author goes on to explain a story of a man who was stuck in his ways and his inability to learn in our ever changing computer science field; this ultimately ended in removal from his company. I found this information relevant and specific to my professional needs. Lastly, I’d like to share some potentially helpful tips for anyone who wants to become involved in an open source community. I advise prioritizing your efforts into learning the social aspect of CS rather than the coding side of things. In open source the question oftentimes isn’t “can you get this code written”;  rather, it’s “can you communicate this code to others”.

#### Initially during week one of my Catalyst experience I was asked the question, what was my greatest thirst for curiosity. I wanted to improve on showcasing my strengths in academic and professional settings. I felt this skill needed the most attention because of my aspirations. Looking back I am proud of my success, but I hope to further my progress. In the future and remainder at Norfolk State University I can be vocal in lectures, accept leadership positions, and network at events. 
#### The most challenging issue in the p5.js repository was an issue where a cohort member and I worked on a piece of code. This code used geometric equations and vibrant colors to create a visually appealing example of the tan() function. This issue was my most difficult because it required me to reach out to community members for approval to modify and submit a pull request for pre-existing code. What started as a solo project challenged me to switch into my collaborative mode. I timeboxed with a cohort member for this issue; so while feeling pressure from a ticking clock, I was also simultaneously writing code with another person for the first time.
#### My favorite issue that I had the privilege to engage with is actually an issue from a cohort member. His issue was trying to convert english documents into spanish. P5.js has other languages, but this issue focused solely on spanish. This issue is a testament to the possibilities of technology. It’s incredible these documents being changed can potentially help an otherwise lost p5.js user. 
#### I learned that surrounding myself with other professionals is important in professional settings. After completing this blog post I will be officially done with OSRE Catalyst! With that being said and with the knowledge I amassed over the summer, I am comfortable contributing to an open-source project in the future. I will likely stay away from open-source well until after I graduate with a bachelors or even masters. I rather spend my youthful adult years traveling and exploring more adventures  in the tech industry. All in all, I enjoyed every part of my summer and am glad I pushed through adversity to make it here today.
#### While in the near future I do plan to explore further into cyber, I wouldn’t mind helping tutor new open-source students. I think this would be an opportunity to take on a mature role and look at academics from a teaching side. Another thing I learned from this program is how group members are vital resources when solving projects. I learned it is okay to ask others for answers that you don’t know. Most importantly I learned how to work alongside a group of colleagues and what amazing things we were able to accomplish!

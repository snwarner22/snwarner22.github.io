#### A problem I hope to solve within the technological field is software being used for nefarious purposes. Peopele taking advantage of others is a vast topic, so I want to focus my efforts towards cybersecurity. Thankfully, I can say I do not know anyone who has been a victim of scamming, stolen bank information, or fraud. However, I have heard countless stories online of others who have been less fortunate. I would like to address this issue within the technological community to protect those who can't protect themselves. I also want to spread awarness, so one day they indeed can protect themselves.

#### Once I become succesful, the first person I want to share my story with is my cousin, NƒÅgi. He sadly passed away almost 5 years ago to this date. I miss him a lot and I fully attribute my intense drive in life to him. I was a hardworker before he passed, but since his death I have definitely ramped up the intensity in which I chase my dreams. I like to think anything I accomplish in my life is in remembrance of him.

#### Fedora Jam is an open source software that is music based. This is a project I can see myself contributing to becuase of my interest in music. I am uncertain if I would be a key contributor to this project ,however, because of how large and popular this project is. I see myself useful by searching through the issues tab for problems left unresolved and within my skillset. From there I would submit a pull request and hope for the best üòÖ.

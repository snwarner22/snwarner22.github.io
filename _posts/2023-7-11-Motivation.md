#### A problem I would love to solve within my lifetime is technology being used for nefarious purposes. Peopele taking advantage of others is a vast topic, so I would like to focus my efforts on cybersecurity. I can thankfully say that I personally, do not know anyone that has been a victim of scamming, stolen bank information, or fraud. However, I've heard countless stories online of others who have been less fortunate. I would like to address this issue within the technological community to protect the people who can't protect themselves and maybe even spread awarness, so one day they indeed can protect themselves.

#### Once I become succesful, the first person I would like to share my story with is my cousin, NƒÅgi. He sadly passed away almost 5 years ago to this date. I miss him a lot and I can 100% attribute my intense drive to him. I was a hardworker before he passed, but since his death I have definitely ramped up the intensity in which I chased my dreams. I like to think that I am living the rest of my life for him and I; anything I accomplish is in remembrance of him.

#### Fedora Jam is an open source software that is music based. This is a project I can see myself contributing to becuase of my interest in music. I am uncertain if I would be a key contributor to this project however, because of how large and popular this project is. I see myself useful by searching through the issues tab for problemsleft unresolved and within my skillset. From there I would submit a pull request and hope for the best üòÖ.

#### While reading the book, How to Open Source, was brought up to speed with an unfamiliar term to me. The term was nonviolent communication (NVC) for short. My curiosity was sparked when Richard Schneeman, the author of HTOS, explained why NVC is valued in community-driven spaces such as open-source communities. I have already begun my plunge into the unknowns of this topic. I plan to read a book on this concept to solidify my roots within this knowledge. The book is titled Nonviolent Communication: A Language of Life and is authored by Marshall B. Rosenberg PhD.
#### I am grateful for the opportunity to sit down and conversate with Richard. While speaking with the group, Richard shared a unique insight; he briefly explained the notion of always acting like people can see your code. I find this insight helpful and agree with his message. This approach to coding makes me want to be a perfectionist at my craft. Like Michelangelo crafting the infamous David, treat your code as a gift to humanity, treating your work as if it were visible to the world is a reminder to programmers everywhere. Give It Their All!
#### In the near future I may find myself pulling an all-nighter tirelessly working on a program assignment. It would be foolish of myself to not think back to this lesson. I will carry this knowledge throughout time of low morale. 
#### To Richard, time has shown trends which make him believe “The longer I’ve been employed as a professional coder, the more I realize that I’m paid […] for my ability to figure out things that I do not know quickly.” Our catalyst summer program has shown how this can be true to a person. During the program I found myself in unfamiliar territory (a lot). Troubleshooting errors, finding clever work-arounds, and reading (lots of reading) made me believe this. Quite honestly, I only utilized information from one particular Norfolk State class which happened to teach unix basics. While it did help how quick and fluid I could obtain new information, my prior knowledge was  less useful than my ability to learn new material and ask thought-provoking questions.

#### While reading *How to Open Source* I was brought up to speed with an unfamiliar term. The term was nonviolent communication or, NVC for short. My curiosity was sparked when Richard Schneeman, the author of *HTOS*, explained why NVC is valued in community-driven spaces such as open-source communities. I have already begun my plunge into the unknowns of this topic. I plan to read *Nonviolent Communication: A Language of Life* that is authored by Marshall B. Rosenberg PhD to solidify my roots within this knowledge.

#### I am grateful for the opportunity to sit down and conversate with Richard. While speaking with the group, Richard shared a unique insight; he briefly explained the notion of always acting like people can see your code. I find this insight helpful and I agree with his message. This approach to coding makes me want to be a perfectionist at my craft. Like Michelangelo crafting the infamous David, treat your code as a gift to humanity. Treating your work as if it were visible to the world is a reminder to a programmer somewhere - Give It Your All!
#### In the near future I may find myself pulling an all-nighter tirelessly working on a program assignment. It would be foolish of myself to not think back to this lesson. I will carry this knowledge throughout any time of low morale. I want to share work that I can be proud of and thanks to Richard I have the tools to make that happen.

#### To Richard, time has shown trends which make him believe “the longer I’ve been employed as a professional coder, the more I realize that I’m paid […] for my ability to figure out things that I do not know quickly.” Our catalyst summer program has shown how this can reality to a person. During the program I found myself in unfamiliar territory (a lot). Troubleshooting errors, finding clever work-arounds, and reading (lots of reading) portrayed this. Quite honestly, I only utilized information from one particular Norfolk State class. While it did help how quick and fluid I could obtain new information, my prior knowledge was  less useful than my ability to learn new material and ask thought-provoking questions.

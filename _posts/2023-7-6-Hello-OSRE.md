title: Goal Setting!
---
#### Hello World! My name is Sekani Warner, I was born and raised in Woodbridge, Virginia (Northern VA). I am currently preparing for my junior year attending Norfolk State University, where I will continue to pursue a degree in computer science. My earliest experience with coding was way back in elementary school along with our robotics team! From that moment on I have had a burning desire to learn and become an achieved programmer. It is something that compliments my strengths, while also challenging me. Just because I love something does not mean it comes naturally easy, and that is something I can live with =) … 

#### OSRE Catalyst has now officially become my first experience working with an open source project. I have quickly grown to love the outreach of this community and the overwhelming support from its members. I hope this program will propel me along my technological journey and solidify my confidence as a programmer. Although it may be my first experience working with open source, I reassure myself  of my hard work, resilience, and drive that it took to get me a spot in this program. The activities I have completed with the help of my mentor, Emily and my groupmates have helped me believe in my skills and have shown me a different perspective on my coding journey.

#### My strongest skill is my determination, and this may sound a little odd, but also my hunger for vengeance. Often my father would tell me whilst playing sports, “don’t wait ‘til someone hits you to fight back”. While fighting physically is not my intention through the duration of this program, I do lean on this teaching. I use my hunger for success as fuel to keep me energized during late night study sessions. Often times while working with technology, especially open source projects, determination to complete your desired task is important. Unlike other practices, the answers you may be searching for won’t always be found with a simple google search. It takes hard work and constant effort to work in this field; my drive is my strongest skill.

#### I would love to further improve on not dimming my light. What I mean by this is when I am in a room full of intelligent people, I often will take a backseat of things. I feel like this bad habit of mine holds myself back, because I miss out on valuable time to gain knowledge. I hope this summer and for the remainder of my time at NSU I am more outgoing, or for better words, let my light shine bright.

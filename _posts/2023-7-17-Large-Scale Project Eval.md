title: Evaluation Time - Times Up!
---
#### This past Friday, my cohort and I worked on an assignment in groups of two. My partner and I had an opportunity to look at the p5.js project which stores its repository on GitHub. Their software was created with artists, designers, and educators in mind. This repository is large; it has a total of 530 contributors as opposed to 112, from the project outlined on Friday’ s blog post. P5.js is an active project and compared to OenSSF Scorecard, the project from Friday’s post, is more active. The first place I would go to if I were interested in this project would be their README.md file, located on their repository; once here I would click the hyperlink titled: “contributor docs”, under the subsection “Getting Started”. This document contains information stating the procedures to become a contributor and this community’s code of conduct, which they refer to as their community statement. 
#### This repository tracks its bugs and feature reports in the “issues” tab on GitHub. There are currently 195 open issues on this repo and an astonishing 3,311 closed ones. This shows me that issues are worked on and resolved in a quick manner. The issues tabs is full of productive conversations between members trying to find a solution, sharing their findings, and supporting one another. Issues are being closed and merged at a quick pace. The newest issue I found that was merged and closed on the issues tab is from five days prior to me writing this post. The open section under the issues tab has not been left abandoned as we see in the numbers. While there are 195 issues currently open, some issues tabs have as many as 16 comments with community members collaborating, trying to resolve the issue.
#### The download and installation process for this software shouldn’t be too difficult; I trust that this process will take no more than a few minutes. This community communicates through an online forum and is active amongst members. All in all, the most fascinating thing I’ve learned through completing this exercise is how vast two open source projects can vary in terms of size, resources, and activity. I have learned much new information today and am glad I pushed through. Based upon my findings in the exercise I completed Friday, I am more inclined to contribute to p5.js due to the quicker response in their slack channel and their expansive closed issues tab.

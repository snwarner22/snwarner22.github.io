title: Evaluation Time - Times Up!
---
#### Today my cohort and I worked on an assignment in groups of two. We had an opportunity to look at two open source projects; the one I will be discussing today is the *OpenSSF Scorecard* project which has its repository on GitHub. The purpose of this project is centered around security for the maintainers of open source projects of their own. This repository in comparison to the other repo we researched today is small. It has a total of 112 contributors as opposed to  530 from the larger one. *OpenSSF* is an active project, but from my findings is less active than the larger project. The first place I would go to if I were interested in this project would be the CONTRIBUTING.md file; here you will find what the next steps are to possibly become a contributor. This document also contains information stating what software you need to have installed to contribute/submit pull requests.

#### Bugs and feature reports are tracked in this repository by using way of the “issues” tab on GitHub. There are currently 368 open issues on *OpenSSF*’s repo, in comparison to 528 closed ones. This is surprising to me; it gives me the impression that there are more issues being found than being resolved. On a positive note, the issues that are currently open receive a lot of community interaction. On a not so happy note, there has not been an issue closed within 3 weeks. Issues tabs are full of productive conversations between members trying to find a solution, sharing their findings, and supporting one another. I can say that issues are being addressed, however, they are not being closed and merged at a quick pace. I’ve found issues dating all the way back to 2020, these are older issues that I am unsure if they will ever be completed. Some are even tagged with a label stating “wishlist”; it seems that this project has chosen to move their efforts and time on other issues. I believe they have left these issues open on up on the issues tab because they hope one day these problems will be solved and merged into their code.

#### The download and installation process for this software shouldn’t be too difficult; I trust that this process will take no more than a few minutes. Developers working on this project use slack to communicate with each other. They have multiple slack channels with specific purposes, per channel names. Channels such as “#general” and “#get-started” are available to members and address questions regarding meeting times, project inquiries, and helpful resources for new members. All in all, the most fascinating thing I’ve learned today, through completing this exercise is how vast two open source projects can vary in terms of size, resources, and activity. I have learned much new information today and am glad I pushed through with the help of my cohort.
